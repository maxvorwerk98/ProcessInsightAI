# InsightProcessAI
ProcessInsightAI is an LLM-powered tool designed to analyze processes using real process data in the form of event logs. Based on the event logs, the tool #   conducts a four-phase technology analysis, structured as follows:

Process Discovery: Performs a fundamental analysis to gain an initial overview of the process, understand its structure, and identify its main steps.
Performance Analysis: Examines the process to identify bottlenecks, delays, inefficiencies, or potential cases of fraud that impact performance.
Technology Analysis: Evaluates suitable technologies to address the previously identified anomalies and provides a detailed plan for their implementation.
Forecasting: Assesses the impact of the selected technologies on the process to analyze their potential benefits and effectiveness.
