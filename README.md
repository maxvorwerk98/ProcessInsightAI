# InsightProcessAI
ProcessInsightAI is an LLM-powered tool designed to analyze processes based on real process data in the form of event logs. Using these event logs, the tool  performs a four-stage technology analysis, divided into the following phases:

- Process Discovery: Fundamental analysis to identify the process structure and key process steps.
- Performance Analysis: Examination of the process to identify delays and bottlenecks affecting performance.
- Weakness Analysis: Investigation of the root causes of previously identified anomalies.
- Technology Analysis: Evaluation of suitable technologies to address the identified anomalies.
